## Description

This website will allow the user to input a series of questions into a website interface and use the results to determine what programming language would best fit the user. The program accomplishes this by taking the answers of several questions and assigning the responses integer values and then multiplying all those integer values before dividing by a constant. This answer will register with a specific value within a dictionary and return a language answer.
